## Use

### Quick Reference

Click the Wildjammer logo in the upper left or use the keybind to open the *Wildjammer Quick Reference* journal. This journal provides an index of the Wildjammer: More Adventures in Space content.

### Wildjammer Sheet

#### PC Mode

This is the default mode available to players.

- Owned ship weapons display facing and location to assist with determining potential targets.
- Bridge crew role assignment is managed via drag and drop of an actor to the sheet.
- Only one actor allowed in unique roles (Captain, Boatswain, Fighter-Helmsman, and Helmsman)
- Dragging an actor to Gunner or Fighter-Helmsman role will present a weapon selection dialog if more than one weapon is available for use in that role. The selected weapon is inherited by the actor and rolled from their sheet in mega scale combat.
- Dragging an actor to the Helmsman role will result in all ship Helmsman equipment/weapons being inherited by the actor to be rolled from their own sheet in mega scale combat.
- Deleting a bridge role assignment or dragging it to Unassigned will remove them from the bridge crew and remove any inherited ship weapon from their actor sheet.

#### NPC Mode

This mode is only available to GMs.

- GM Visible *NPC Ship* toggle enters NPC mode.
  - Any PCs assigned to bridge crew roles will be removed upon entering NPC mode.
- Ability scores and proficiency may be configured as needed.
- Roll weapon attacks and other items directly from the sheet.
- Roll ability checks or saving throws for the ship by clicking the appropriate ability.

### Cone of Movement

- By default, the cone of movement template is bound to `m`. This key may be changed in *Configure Controls*. Select a wildjammer ship token and use the bound key to toggle the cone of movement template on and off.
